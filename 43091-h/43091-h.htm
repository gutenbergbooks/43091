<p class="blockquot">It is generally believed that the system of feudal tenures was legally
established in England at the Council of Salisbury, held either in
1085 or 1086. The great characteristic of the feudal system was that
the obligation of military or knight’s service was annexed to the
tenure of land held of the sovereign. The estates, or fiefs of the
tenants-in-chief, consisted of one or more knight’s fees; and for
every fee the king might claim the military service of an armed knight
for forty days a year. The holders of these estates, on taking
possession, were required to do homage, and to swear fealty to the
king; and on particular and specified occasions other services were
exacted. The holders of large estates often granted portions of their
land to under-vassals, from whom they received services similar to
those which they themselves rendered to their sovereign. The number of
knight’s fees in England was 60,215.</p>

<p class="hangdent">About this time <i>the ecclesiastical was separated from the civil
jurisdiction</i>; all causes of the Church were to be tried before clerical
tribunals.</p>

<p class="hang">1086. <b>Domesday Book completed.</b></p>

other important particulars.</p>

<p class="hang">1087. William engaged in war with Philip I. of France. He was seriously

<p class="blockquot">The object of the interdict was to induce John to acknowledge the
archbishop. When a country was laid under an interdict the churches

him to grant a charter, known as <i>MAGNA CHARTA</i>. The pope annulled the
charter; and the king, refusing to abide by it, collected foreign
mercenaries, and ravaged the lands of the barons.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Magna Charta (or the Great Charter), is justly recognized as the
keystone of English liberty. It contained 63 clauses, among the most
important of which were that no freeman should be dispossessed of his
property, imprisoned, or outlawed contrary to law;&mdash;that justice
should not be sold, delayed, or refused to any one;&mdash;that no one
should be fined except by his peers, and in proportion to his
fault;&mdash;that no taxes save certain therein specified should be granted
except by parliament;&mdash;that justices should go through each county
four times a year to try causes;&mdash;that weights and measures should be
justly fixed;&mdash;and that merchants should have liberty to enter and

power; and at a parliament held at Oxford, unjustly called THE MAD
PARLIAMENT, <b>they drew up some ordinances for the reformation of the

<p class="blockquot">Two of the most important provisions were, that four knights should be

<p class="hang">1259. Henry formally renounced all claim to the English possessions in

<p class="hang">1265. <i>ORIGIN Of POPULAR REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT.</i> The first

<p class="note"><b>D.</b> He was the son of Edward II. <b>B.</b> at Windsor, 1312. <b>M.</b> Philippa, daughter

50½ years (1327 to 1377).</p>

<p class="hang">1327. Parliament appointed a council of regency, at the head of which was
Henry, earl of Lancaster; but all the real power was exercised by the
queen and Mortimer. The Scots, under Bruce, invaded England; and Edward,
in pursuing them, narrowly escaped capture.</p>

<p class="hang">1328. Peace concluded between the two countries, by which the <b>independence
of Scotland was completely recognized</b>.</p>

<p class="hang">1329. Death of Robert Bruce, and accession of his son, David II.</p>

<p class="hang">1333. Edward supported Edward Baliol (son of John Baliol), in his attempt
to obtain the crown of Scotland, and gained an important victory at
<span class="smcap">Halidon Hill</span> (July 19). Berwick, which he had been besieging, surrendered
the next day.</p>

<p class="hang">1339. <b>WAR WITH FRANCE.</b> Edward invaded France.</p>

<p class="blockquot">This war arose mainly from two causes:&mdash;1, the aid that the French had
rendered to the Scots in the late war; 2, Edward’s claim to the French
crown. Louis X., Philip V., and Charles IV. had died in succession
without male issue; and as females were excluded from the throne,
Philip of Valois was chosen king (1328), and Edward, though he had
claimed the crown, did homage to him for the duchy of Guienne as his
liege lord. Edward’s claim, as son of Isabella, sister of these three
kings, was essentially defective, for he had to contend, that though
females were excluded, such exclusion did not apply to their children;
but, admitting that such children were eligible, Charles of Navarre,
grandson of Louis X. (born after Edward had put forth his first
pretension), had a better right than he. After the campaign of 1340 it
is probable that Edward would have totally abandoned the enterprise
had it not been for a revolution in Brittany, which furnished him with
another opportunity of taking up arms.</p>

<p class="hang">1340. Edward gained a great victory over the French fleet at <span class="smcap">Sluys</span> (June

France.</p>

<p class="hang">1349. England ravaged by a great pestilence called the Black Plague.
50,000 persons are said to have died in London alone. There was a second
plague of 1361, and a third in 1369. <b>Order of the Garter established.</b>
<i>Statute of Labourers</i> passed: labourers ordered to work at the ordinary
wages for any one who required their services.</p>

<p class="hang">1351. <i>Second Statute of Labourers</i> passed, fixing the wages of labourers
and artificers. <i>Statute of Treason</i>, defining the crime of high treason.

in France.</p>

<p class="hang">1360. <span class="gothic">Treaty of Bretigny</span>, between England and France (May 8).</p>

<p class="blockquot">Edward renounced his claim to the crown of France, and the ancient
possessions of his family, but he was to hold, in full sovereignty,
Calais, Guisnes, Ponthieu, Poitou, Guienne, and their dependencies.</p>

<p class="hang">1362. A statute passed, enacting that pleadings in law courts should be
conducted in English.</p>

<p class="hang">1367. The Black Prince aided Don Pedro of Castile, and gained the battle
of <span class="smcap">Navarette</span>, by which the tyrant was restored to his throne.</p>

<p class="hang">1370. The bishop and people of Limoges having admitted a French garrison,
the Black Prince invested and captured the town: 3,000 men, women, and
children were butchered in cold blood.</p>

<p class="hang">1374. The only possessions that the English retained in France were
Calais, Bordeaux, Bayonne, and a few places on the Dordogne.</p>

<p class="hang">1381. <span class="smcap">Wat Tyler’s Insurrection</span>: caused immediately by the capitation tax,
and its rigorous mode of collection. The insurrection broke out in Kent
under Tyler, and in Essex under Jack Straw. The rebels marched to London,
and committed great excesses. Richard met them at Smithfield, where Tyler
was struck down by the Lord Mayor, and slain. Several concessions were
granted to the insurgents, and afterwards revoked.</p>

<p class="hang">1384. Death of John Wycliffe, the ‘Morning Star of the Reformation.’</p>

<p class="blockquot">This famous divine, born in 1324, held doctrines very similar to those
of the Reformers of the sixteenth century: and by his efforts and
those of his disciples they were extensively spread among the people.
His followers were called Wycliffites, or Lollards. His writings are
very numerous, but the most celebrated is his translation of the Bible
into English.</p>

<p class="hang">1385. The Scots having made incursions in the north of England, Richard
advanced against them, and burnt Edinburgh, Dunfermline, Perth, and
Dundee.</p>

<p class="hang">1386. The king’s favourites, De Vere, duke of Ireland, and De la Pole,

loss of lands and goods.</p>

<p class="hang">1397. The duke of Gloucester arrested and conveyed to Calais, where it was
generally believed he was murdered.</p>

<p class="hang">1398. A Parliament at Shrewsbury reversed the acts of the Wonderful
Parliament. Richard banished the Duke of Hereford (Henry Bolingbroke) for
ten years, and the duke of Norfolk for life. <b>The king’s power nearly
absolute.</b></p>

<p class="hang">1399. Richard visited Ireland. During his absence Hereford, who, by his
father’s death, had become duke of Lancaster, invaded England professedly
to recover his estates and honours. On Richard’s return he obtained

Indecisive battle at <span class="smcap">Edgehill</span>, in Warwickshire (Oct. 23).</p>

<p class="blockquot">The immediate cause of the rebellion, says Lord Brougham, were&mdash;1. The
religious zeal, or rather fury, excited by the encouragement which the
king and queen gave to Popery, and which was greatly magnified, at
least as concerned him. 2. A conspiracy was discovered of some leading
persons in the king’s party to march the army to London and subdue the
parliament. 3. That which, more than all the rest, hurried on matters
to extremities, was the insane step he took of entering, in person,
the House of Commons, and claiming the surrender of five members, the
leaders of the party opposed to him, but who had the whole Commons and
nearly the whole Lords for their followers. That it led immediately to
the vote which vested in parliament the nomination of militia
officers&mdash;in other words, the command of the army&mdash;cannot be doubted;
and this was the commencement of the Civil War.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Corporation Act, the Act of Uniformity, the Conventicle Act, and

required all persons holding offices in municipal corporations to take
the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper according to the rites of the
Church of England&mdash;to renounce the Solemn League and Covenant&mdash;and to
swear that they believed it unlawful to take up arms, upon any
pretence whatsoever, against the king. The Act of Uniformity required
all clergymen to declare their assent to everything contained in the
Prayer Book, and all schoolmasters were obliged to have a licence from
the bishop. About 2,000 clergymen declined to subscribe, and were
ejected from their livings: and, receiving no compensation from the
state, were, in many cases, reduced to the utmost poverty. The
Conventicle Act declared all meetings of more than five persons,
except the household, for religious worship not according to the
Prayer Book, seditious; and all persons above sixteen years old, who
attended, for a first offence were to be fined or imprisoned for three
months; for a second, fined or imprisoned for six months; and for a
third, transported for seven years. The Five Mile Act required all
dissenting ministers to take an oath similar to that imposed by the

<p class="hang">1672. Charles shut up the exchequer, and thereby ruined a large number of

dissolved in 1679.</p>

<p class="hang">1679. Charles called a third parliament.<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> A new ministry formed by Sir

Shaftesbury (Ashley) removed from the presidency of the council, and Sir
William Temple and other ministers soon resigned.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Habeas Corpus Act was passed to prevent the illegal and indefinite
imprisonment to which persons obnoxious to the government could be
subjected. By its provisions&mdash;1. All persons except those charged with
treason or felony could demand from one of the judges a writ of Habeas
Corpus, directing the jailor to bring them before him, so that the
validity of their detention might be tested. 2. All persons charged
with treason or felony must be tried at the next sessions after
commitment, or else admitted to bail, and if not tried at the second
sessions they must be discharged. 3. No person could be recommitted

<p class="hang">1681. A fifth parliament met at Oxford, but as the Commons resolved to
introduce an exclusion bill it was hastily dissolved. Shaftesbury charged
with high treason, but the grand jury threw out the bill. <b>The king’s

Spanish dominions on the death of Charles II., king of Spain. A second
treaty was concluded in 1700.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The purpose of these private treaties was to prevent the
disarrangement of the balance of power which would ensue in case the
whole of the Spanish dominions fell into the hands of Louis’ son, the
dauphin. By the first treaty they were to be divided between the
electoral prince of Bavaria, the Dauphin, and the archduke Charles,
all of whom had pretensions to the Spanish throne. On the death of the
electoral prince (in 1699) they were to be divided between the
survivors. Charles, on his death, left the whole to Philip of Anjou,
grandson of Louis, who determined, in spite of his agreement with
William, to support his grandson; and hence ensued the war in the next
reign.</p>

Several provisions were inserted which were to take effect from the
accession of the new line:&mdash;1. The sovereign must join in communion
with the Church of England. 2. The nation shall not be obliged to go
to war for the defence of any dominions not belonging to the English
crown. 3. No English sovereign shall leave the kingdom without consent
of parliament. 4. All important matters of state are to be transacted
in the privy council, and all resolutions adopted signed by such of
the privy council as shall advise and consent to the same. 5. No
foreigner shall hold any office, civil or military, or receive any
grant from the crown. 6. No person, holding any office or place of
profit under the crown, and receiving a pension therefrom, shall be
capable of sitting in the house of commons. 7. Judges shall hold
office during good behaviour, but they may be removed on address of
both houses of parliament. 8. No pardon under the great seal shall be
pleadable to an impeachment by the Commons. The third provision was
repealed in the first year of George I.’s reign.</p>

(April 11 and July 13).</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>The terms of this treaty were very much more favourable to the French
than they could have reasonably expected, and than they would have
been, had the Whigs remained in power. Among the principal terms that
concerned England were&mdash;1, That the French and Spanish crowns should
never become united; 2, That the Protestant succession should be
acknowledged by France; 3, That the fortifications of Dunkirk should
be destroyed; 4, That Hudson’s Bay, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia,
Gibraltar, and Minorca should be ceded to England. The principal
object of the war&mdash;the exclusion of the Bourbons from the throne of
Spain&mdash;was not secured. At the close of the war the national debt was about £38,000,000.</p>

<p class="hang">1714. Death of the Princess Sophia. <i>Schism Act</i> passed. Harley removed
from office, and succeeded by his colleague St. John, created Viscount
Bolingbroke. He plotted to restore the Pretender on the death of the
queen, but her sudden illness enabled the dukes of Shrewsbury, Somerset,
and Argyle, three of the Whig leaders, to thwart his intentions, for the
lord treasurer’s staff was bestowed on the first-mentioned peer&mdash;“the only
individual who mainly assisted in both the great changes of dynasty of
1688 and 1714.”</p>

<p class="blockquot">The object of the Schism Act was to prevent Dissenters from acting as
tutors or schoolmasters; but it did not come into operation, on account of the death of the queen.</p>
